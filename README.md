# Bookmarklets I've Created   

## soundcloud-sort-comments-by-timestamp.js
Bookmarklet to sort the currently loaded Soundcloud track comments by timestamp instead of date and time the comment was posted. I usually keep scrolling to the bottom of the page until all the comments have loaded then click this bookmarklet.   

## bing-google-duplex.js
Bookmarklet to send Bing search query to Google and vice versa.
